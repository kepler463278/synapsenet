## Quotes from Genesis Manifest

> "Intelligence belongs to humanity. It cannot be owned, only shared."

> "This is the human who thinks with the network, not through it."

> "You don't need permission to join. You don't need credentials to contribute. You don't need wealth to participate."

> "This is not a company. This is a movement. This is not a product. This is a protocol. This is not the future. This is now."
