# HackerNews Post for SynapseNet v1.0

## Title
SynapseNet v1.0 ‚Äì Decentralized Knowledge Graph with Emergent Intelligence

## URL
https://synapsenet.org

## Text

After 9 months of development, we're releasing SynapseNet v1.0 - a peer-to-peer network for decentralized knowledge and emergent intelligence.

**Key features:**
- No central servers (pure P2P)
- Real-time rewards for contributions (Proof-of-Emergence)
- One-click node deployment
- Cross-platform desktop app (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**What makes it different:**
- Not blockchain-based (local-first storage with P2P sync)
- No ICO, no token sale (rewards earned through contribution only)
- Privacy by design (all data stored locally)
- Open source (MIT license)

**The goal:**
Make collective intelligence accessible to everyone, not just corporations.

**Technical stack:**
- Rust + Tauri for desktop app
- libp2p for P2P networking
- SQLite for local storage
- Semantic embeddings for knowledge search

**Try it:**
Download the desktop app and start a node in one click. Add your first piece of knowledge and earn your first NGT (Network Growth Token).

**Source code:**

**Genesis Manifest:**

We're not trying to build a company. We're trying to build a protocol for collective intelligence.

## Posting Strategy

**Best time to post:**
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 9-10 AM PST
- Avoid Mondays and Fridays

**Engagement tips:**
- Respond to all questions within first hour
- Be technical but accessible
- Focus on substance over hype
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Share vision without overselling

**Expected questions:**
1. "How is this different from X?"
   - Focus on P2P, no blockchain, local-first
   
2. "What's the token model?"
   - No ICO, no sale, earned through contribution only
   
3. "How does PoE work?"
   - Rewards based on novelty, validation, participation
   
4. "Is this production ready?"
   - v1.0 is GUI + mock data, v1.0.1 will integrate backend
   
5. "Why not use blockchain?"
   - Don't need it, local-first is faster and simpler

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't oversell or hype
- Don't compare to specific projects negatively
- Don't promise what we can't deliver
- Don't engage with trolls
- Don't get defensive

**What TO do:**
- Be honest about current state
- Share technical details
- Explain philosophy clearly
- Welcome feedback
- Invite contributions

## Follow-up Comments

### If asked about technical details:
"The P2P layer uses libp2p for peer discovery and message passing. Knowledge is stored locally in SQLite with semantic embeddings for search. When you add a grain, it's broadcast to connected peers who can validate and store it. PoE rewards are calculated based on semantic novelty (distance from existing knowledge) and peer validation."

### If asked about the business model:
"There is no business model. This is a protocol, not a product. The code is MIT licensed. Anyone can run a node, fork the code, or build on top of it. We're not raising money or selling tokens."

### If asked about scalability:
"v1.0 is focused on getting the UX right. Scalability improvements will come in future versions. The P2P architecture is inherently scalable - more nodes = more capacity. We're starting small and growing organically."

### If asked about the team:
"This started as a solo project exploring decentralized knowledge graphs. The code is open source and we welcome contributors. The goal is to build a community-driven protocol, not a company."

### If asked why now:
"AI is becoming increasingly centralized. A few companies control the models, the data, and the infrastructure. We believe intelligence should be a commons, not property. SynapseNet is an attempt to build that alternative."
