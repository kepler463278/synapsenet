## 📝 Notes

### What's Working
- Complete GUI with all screens
- Real-time event system
- Reward tracking and display
- Genesis Manifest integration
- Full website with documentation

### What Needs Integration
- Actual P2P network connection (v0.9 integration)
- Real storage backend (v0.9 integration)
- Actual PoE calculation (v0.9 integration)
- Real swarm consensus (v0.8 integration)

### Current State
The GUI is **fully functional** with mock data. Integration with v0.9 backend
requires connecting the Tauri commands to actual SynapseNet core functionality.

This is intentional - the GUI can be developed, tested, and refined independently,
then connected to the real backend when ready.

## 🌟 The Vision

**v1.0 is the moment SynapseNet becomes accessible to everyone.**

Not just developers. Not just enthusiasts. **Everyone.**

This is when technology meets philosophy meets accessibility.

**Technology (v0.5-v0.9) → People (v1.0)**
