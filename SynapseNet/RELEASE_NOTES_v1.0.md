## 💡 What This Means

- Code becomes movement

**Before v1.0:**
- Command-line only
- Technical users only
- GitHub repository

**After v1.0:**
- One-click GUI
- Anyone can use
- Public website
- Global movement

## 🎨 Philosophy

From the Genesis Manifest:

> "This is not just software.

**Core Beliefs:**
- Intelligence belongs to humanity, not corporations
- Knowledge should flow freely, not be locked behind walls
- Your contributions should be rewarded, not exploited
- Privacy and autonomy are fundamental rights
