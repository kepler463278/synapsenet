### For Users
"SynapseNet makes collective intelligence accessible to everyone. Download the app, start a node with one click, add your knowledge, and earn rewards. No technical knowledge required."

### For Developers
"Open source (MIT), built with Rust + Tauri, uses libp2p for P2P, SQLite for storage, and semantic embeddings for search. The code is clean, well-documented, and ready for contributions."
