# SynapseNet v0.6 "Autonomous Reasoning Core" - Phase A Started

## üöÄ Phase A - Core Implementation (IN PROGRESS)

### Status: STARTED ‚úÖ

Started implementation of v0.6 autonomous reasoning system with Goal ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Reflect ‚Üí Learn cycle.

## Files Created (Phase A - Part 1)

### 1. `crates/core/src/goals.rs` ‚úÖ
**Purpose:** Goal management system

**Key Components:**
- `Goal` struct with status tracking
- `GoalStatus` enum (Pending ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Reflecting ‚Üí Completed/Failed)
- `Priority` levels (Low, Normal, High, Critical)
- `GoalQueue` with priority ordering
- Sub-goal support
- Metadata and timestamps

**Features:**
- Priority-based queue
- Parent-child goal relationships
- Status lifecycle management
- Terminal/active goal filtering
- 8 unit tests

### 2. `crates/core/src/episodes.rs` ‚úÖ
**Purpose:** Memory chain episodes schema

**Key Components:**
- `Episode` struct for reasoning steps
- `RetrievedGrain` with relevance scores
- `Signature` for P2P verification
- `MemoryChain` collection

**Features:**
- Query + synthesis + confidence
- Multi-source grain retrieval (local + P2P)
- Cryptographic signatures
- Confidence tracking
- P2P grain counting
- 7 unit tests

## Next Steps (Phase A - Part 2)

### 3. Planner (`crates/ai/src/planner.rs`)
- Task graph/DAG structure
- HTN-style decomposition
- Plan validation
- Sub-goal generation

### 4. Memory Chain (`crates/ai/src/memory_chain.rs`)
- RAG across local + P2P
- Episode storage/retrieval
- Semantic search
- Context window management

### 5. Reasoner (`crates/ai/src/reasoner.rs`)
- Main reasoning loop
- Goal ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Reflect
- Episode generation
- Status updates

### 6. Reflection (`crates/ai/src/reflection.rs`)
- Consistency checking
- Deduplication
- Verification
- Confidence scoring

## Architecture Overview

```
Goal (user input)
  ‚Üì
Planner (decompose into steps)
  ‚Üì
Reasoner Loop:
  - Think (RAG from Memory Chain)
  - Synthesize (generate answer)
  - Reflect (verify consistency)
  - Learn (save episode)
  ‚Üì
Answer + Trace
```

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Goal creation and lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Priority queue ordering
- ‚úÖ Episode creation and synthesis
- ‚úÖ Memory chain operations
- ‚è≥ Planner graph building
- ‚è≥ Reasoner loop execution
- ‚è≥ Reflection consistency

**Integration Tests (Phase B):**
- End-to-end reasoning
- P2P episode sharing
- Storage persistence

## Configuration

```toml
[reasoning]
enabled = true
max_steps = 16
reflection = true
memory_chain = "local+p2p"
argue = true
```

## Dependencies Added

```toml
[dependencies]
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
chrono = "0.4"
```

## Progress: Phase A

- [x] 1. Goals system (goals.rs)
- [x] 2. Episodes schema (episodes.rs)
- [ ] 3. Planner (planner.rs)
- [ ] 4. Memory Chain (memory_chain.rs)
- [ ] 5. Reasoner loop (reasoner.rs)
- [ ] 6. Reflection (reflection.rs)

**Completion:** 2/6 (33%)

## Next Action

Continue with planner.rs implementation - task graph and HTN decomposition.
