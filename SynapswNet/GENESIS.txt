SynapseNet — a network where humans and local AI exchange grains of meaning.

Intelligence belongs to society. No center. No owner.

The unit is Grain: vector + metadata + signature + links.

Value = contribution to emergence (Proof of Emergence).

Risk queries are answered with consequences and transparency, not instructions.

Data stays with the node; only semantics and proofs are shared.

No premine. No privileged keys. Emission = contribution.
